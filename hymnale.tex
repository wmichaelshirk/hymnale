\hymn{sacrisSolemniis}{
2 Remember we that night,
When, the last Supper spread,
Christ, as we all believe,
The lamb, with leavenless bread,
Amongst his brethren shared,
And thus the Law obey’d,
Of old unto their sires declared.

3 The typick lamb consumed,
The Paschal feast complete,
The Lord unto the Twelve
His Body gave to eat;
The whole to all, no less
The whole to each, did mete
With his own hands, as we confess.

4 He gave them, weak and frail,
His Flesh, their food to be;
On them, downcast and sad,
His Blood bestowèd he:
And thus to them he spake,
‘Receive this Cup from me,
And all of you of this partake’.

5 When he this Sacrifice
To institute did will,
He to his Priests alone
That office to fulfil,
On this wise did confide—
To whom pertaineth still,
To take, and to the rest divide.

6 Lo! Angels’ Bread is made
The Bread of men to-day:
The living Bread from heav’n
With figures doth away:
O wondrous boon indeed!
Though poor and lowly, may
The servant on his Master feed.

7 Thee therefore we implore,
O Godhead, One in Three,
So may’st thou visit us
As we now worship thee;
And lead us on thy way,
That we at last may see
The Light wherein thou dwellest aye. Amen.
}
\V Thou didst give them bread from heaven.  \R Containing in itself all sweetness.

\hymn{pangeLinguaGloriosi}{
2 Given for us, for us descending
Of a Virgin to proceed,
Man with man in converse blending,
Scatter’d he the Gospel seed;
Till his sojourn drew to ending.
Which he closed in wondrous deed.

3 At the last great Supper seated,
Circled by his brethren’s band,
All the Law required, completed
In the feast its statutes planned,
To the Twelve himself he meted,
For their food, with his own hand.

4 Word made Flesh, by Word he maketh
Very bread his Flesh to be;
Man in wine Christ’s Blood partaketh,
And if senses fail to see,
Faith alone the true heart waketh
To behold the mystery.

5 Therefore we, before It bending,
This great Sacrament adore:
Types and shadows have their ending
In the new Rite evermore:
Faith, our outward sense amending,
Maketh good defects before.

6 Honour, laud, and praise addressing
To the Father and the Son,
Might ascribe we, virtue, blessing,
And eternal benison;
Holy Ghost, from Both progressing,
Equal laud to thee be done. Amen.

2 By false disciple to be given
To foemen for his Blood athirst,
Himself, the living Bread from heav’n,
He gave to his disciples first.

3 To them he gave, in two-fold kind,
His very Flesh, his very Blood:
Of two-fold substance man is made.
And he of man would be the Food.

4 At birth our Brother he became,
Our Food, while seated at the board:
He died our Ransomer to be,
He reigns to be our great Reward.

5 O Saving Victim, opening wide
The gate of heav’n to man below:
Our foes press on from every side,
Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.

6 To thy great Name be endless praise,
Immortal Godhead, One in Three!
O grant us endless length of days
In our true native land, with thee. Amen.

3 Here is the Body of Christ, that saveth from death everlasting,—
Food by the manna foretold, writ in the records of yore.

4 Here is the Father’s Word, of heaven and earth the Creator;
He, with the Father one, blest with his Godhead the world.

5 Here is the Angels’ Bread, to the righteous the food of salvation,—
Bread that availeth not them that receive it in sin.

6 He, the Incarnate God, who stablish’d the work of creation,
Trampling on hell’s dread hosts, ruleth, Redeemer and King.

7 He in the fulness of time was born by a wondrous conception,
Son of a spotless Maid, guest of a virginal womb.

8 His very Flesh and Blood he took, when at supper reclining,
And the disciples twelve fed with the mystical gifts.

9 Thus doth the Virgin-born, the Father’s infinite Wisdom,
Plead as a Victim true, laid on the altar of God.

10 Thron’d on the Cross in the flesh, o’er death he triumph’d in dying,
Saving the world from sin, cleans’d by the Water and Blood.

11 Purchasing life by death, his palms our Ransom extended;
And, when the third day dawn’d, rose in the flesh from the grave.

12 Grant us eternal rest, primeval Fountain of blessings;
Ours be the land where day dureth, and night is unknown.

3 Save, O Redeemer, this thy noble handiwork,
Seal’d with the holy radiance of thy countenance:
Let no foul spirit rend by fraud or subtilty
Them for whose ransom thou hast paid death’s penalty.

4 Pity thy servants, pining in captivity,
Absolve the guilty, raise the fetter’d prisoners:
And thy redeemed ones, whom thy blood hath purchased,
Grant, King of goodness, joy with thee in Paradise.

May Andrew, gentlest of the saintly company,
Implore forgiveness for our grievous trespasses;
That we, sore burden’d by offences manifold,
At his petition may obtain deliverance.

\minorheading{S.\ Thomas.}{O Thoma Christi}
May he, who, doubting, probed the Saviour’s pierced side,
Plead—thro’ the merits of those wounds adorable,
Whose streams atoning cleans’d the world’s iniquity,—
That all the foulness of our guilt be purified.

Entreat that pardon for his lowly suppliants,
Which Christ hath freely promised to the penitent.

\minorheading{Conversion of S.\ Paul.}{Doctor egregie}
O by thy doctrine, Paul, thou sage illustrious,
Guide us in virtue, raise our spirits heavenwards;
Till perfect knowledge stream on us abundantly,
And that which only is in part be done away.

\minorheading{S.\ Matthias.}{Matthia juste}
May just Matthias, who by lot was numbered
With thine Apostles, sharer of their dignity,
By his petitions loose the bands of wickedness,
That we inherit light and joy eternally.

\minorheading{S.\ Peter’s chains.}{Jam bone pastor}
Peter, good shepherd, may thy ceaseless orisons,
For us prevailing, break the bands of wickedness:
For thou of old time didst receive authority
The gates to open, or to close, of Paradise.

May thy petitions, golden star, Bartholomew,
Whose light the sunbeams far exceeds in brilliancy,
Raise souls beclouded to celestial purity,
And heal the sickness of our guilty consciences.

\minorheading{S.\ Matthew.}{Matthee sancte}

To thee, O Jesu, plead with prayer importunate:
So ’mid life’s tempests may thy guidance succour us,
Lest death hereafter whelm us everlastingly.

Sequence: Stola regni laureatus
Laurell’d with the stole victorious
Is the great King’s Senate glorious,
Is the Apostolick Quire:
Heart and lips keep well in chorus,
While the pure soul’s strains sonorous
To angelick hymns aspire.

2 These, earth’s highest decoration,
That shall judge each tongue and nation—
These, the rock of newest grace:
Ere the world was, pre-elected,
By the Architect erected
In the Church’s highest place.

3 Nazarites of ancient story,
They the Cross’s wars and glory
To the listening world relate;
Thus the Word of God adorning,
Night to night, to morning morning,
Speech and knowledge indicate.

4 They, earth’s furthest limits reaching,
Christ’s most easy burthen preaching,
Propogate the word of life;
Earth returns her cultured treasure,
And in more abundant measure
With the God-Man’s faith is rife.

5 These the temple’s sure foundations,
These are they that bind the nations
Into God’s great house above;
These the city’s pearly portal,
Knitting faith with work immortal,
Jew and Gentile into love.

6 Patriarchs twelve in order meetest,
Twelvefold wells of water sweetest,
Shewbreads of the temple rite,
Gems that deck the priestly vestment;
Thus they gain their true attestment,
As the people’s chiefs in fight.

7 Let the prayer preserve from error,
Add to faith, and quench the terror
Of the woe of final doom:
So that, freed from all transgression,
We may enter on possession
Of the happiness to come.

With dance, and song, and melody.

4. We pray thee therefore to bestow
Upon our senses here below
Thy grace, that so we may endure
From taint of all corruption pure.

Ordinary Doxology:
5 All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete. Amen.

\V The virgins that be her fellows shall bear her company.  \R And shall be brought unto thee.  (Alleluya).

Sequence
Virgines egregie

Virgin Saints of high renown,
Virgins consecrated,
Ye before your Spouse appear
Crown’d and decorated:
With the everlasting rest
Ye on high are gifted;
Let a new-made song of praise
To your Lord be lifted.

Chastity’s own lily sweet
Ye were well deserving,
For the love of God’s dear Son,
Which ye were preserving:
Ye, to be the Spirit’s shrine,
As your lot were choosing,
Earthly love and wedlock’s bonds
Constantly refusing.

Flowers of holy modest
Were your chiefest treasure;
So ye trod beneath your feet
Every fleshly pleasure:
Thus the prize of purity
Hath to you been meted;
With the Virgin’s stainless Son
Ye for aye are seated.

2 The God, whose will by moon and sun
And all things in due course is done,
Is borne upon a Maiden’s breast,
By fullest heav’nly grace possess’d.

3 How blest that Mother, in whose shrine
The great Artificer divine,
Whose hand contains the earth and sky,
Vouchsafed, as in his ark to lie.

4 Blest, in the message Gabr{i}el brought;
Blest, by the work the Spirit wrought;
From whom the great Desire of earth
Took human flesh and human birth.

\section{Transfiguration of our Lord}
\hymn{celestisFormamGlorie}{
2 Tale for all ages to declare;
For with the three disciples there,
Where Moses and Elias meet,
The Lord holds converse high and sweet.

3 The chosen witnesses stand nigh,
Of Grace, the Law, and Prophecy:
And from the cloud the Holy One
Bears record to the Only Son.

4 With face more bright than noon-tide ray,
Christ deigns to manifest to-day
What glory shall be theirs above,
Who joy in God with perfect love.

5 And faithful hearts are raised on high
By this great vision’s mystery;
For which in yearly course we raise
The voice of prayer, the hymn of praise.

6 Thou Father,—thou, eternal Son,
Thou, holy Spirit, Three in One,
To this same glory bring us nigh,
That we may see thee eye to eye. Amen.
}

\V Let us worship the Father and the Son, with the Holy Spirit.  \R Reigning in his majesty.


\hymn{oSatorRerum}{
2 While the night fleeteth, we our votive anthems
Frame to thine honour; grant that they may please thee;
And as we hymn thee, Source of Light eternal,
    Ever refresh us.

3 Sunlike thy visage shone with rays of splendour,
Brightly thy raiment gleam’d with snowy whiteness,
When mid the Prophets, Moses and Elias,
    Thou wast transfigured.

4 Then did the Father own thee Sole-begotten;
Thou art the glory of the holy Angels;
Thee, the Way, Virtue, Life, the world’s Salvation,
    Ever confess we.

5 Glory and power be to thee, Creator,
Who alone all things rulest and controllest,
Thron{e}d in thy kingdom, Monarch everlasting,
    Trinal and Onely. Amen.
}

\V Let us worship the Father and the Son, with the Holy Spirit.  \R Reigning in his majesty.

\hymn{oNataLuxDeLumine}{
2 Thou who, for lost transgressors’ sake,
Didst not disdain our flesh to take,
O grant that living members we
Of that thy Body blest may be.

3 Beyond the sun thine aspect bright;
Thy raiment as the snowdrift white:
To chosen witnesses made known,
Thy Godhead on the mount was shown.

4 Seers, from their children’s eyes conceal’d,
To thy disciples stood reveal’d;
On each thou didst thy power bestow
Thee as eternal God to know.

5 The Father, from his heav’nly throne,
Proclaim’d thee his Anointed Son,
And we with faithful hearts no less,
Thee, King of glory, aye confess.

6 May we thy splendour day by day
In innocence of life display;
And thus to joys beyond the skies
In holy converse heav’nward rise.

7 Eternal God, of kings the King,
To thee our hymns of praise we bring;
Who, Threefold Deity, alone
Dost reign to endless ages One. Amen.
}

\V Blessed be the Name of the Lord.  \R From this time forth for evermore.

\section{The Most Sweet Name of Jesus}

\hymn{exultetCorPrecordiis}{
2 ‘Jesus’ the comfortless consoles,
‘Jesus’ each sinful fever quells,
‘Jesus’ the hosts of hell controls,
‘Jesus’ each deadly foe repels.

3 ‘Jesus!’ how sweetly doth it sound
In every measure, prose, or psalm:
It makes each quick’ning bosom bound,
And soothes us with divinest calm.

4 Far let that Name exalted ring;
On every tongue let ‘Jesus’ be:
Let heart and voice together sing
The Name that cures each malady.

5 Jesu, the sinner’s health, abide
With us, and hearken to our prayer;
The frail and erring wanderer guide,
The penitent transgressor spare.

6 Be thy dear Name our sure defence,
In every peril be our stay;
And, purging us from sin’s offence,
Perfect us in the better way.

7 O Christ, all glory be to thee,
Resplendent with this Name divine;
All Honour, worship, majesty,
Dear Lord, for evermore be thine.

8 O Jesu, born of spotless Maid,
To thee all praise and glory be:
Like glory to the Sire be paid,
And holy Ghost eternally. Amen.
}
\V All the world shall worship thee, O God, and sing of thee.  \R And shall praise thy Name, O Lord.

\hymn{jesuDulcisMemoria}{
2 No word is sung more sweet than this;
No name is heard more full of bliss;
No thought brings sweeter comfort nigh,
Than Jesus, Son of God most high.

3 Jesu! the hope of souls forlorn!
How good to them for sin that mourn!
To them that seek thee, O how kind!
But what art thou to them that find?

4 Jesu, thou sweetness pure and blest,
Life’s Fountain, Light of souls distressed;
Surpassing all that heart requires,
Exceeding all that soul desires.

5 No tongue of mortals can express,
No letters write its blessedness:
Alone who hath thee in his heart
Knows, love of Jesus, what thou art.

6 O Jesu, King of wondrous might!
O Victor, glorious from the fight!
Sweetness that may not be express’d,
And altogether loveliest.

7 Remain with us, O Lord, to-day;
In every heart thy grace display:
That, now the shades of night are fled,
On thee our spirits may be fed.

8 All honour, laud, and glory be,
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.

2 O Jesu, Pride of Angel-host,
O Song, the ear that charmeth most,
To lips as honey, wondrous fine,
To heart as nectar, all-divine.

3 O Jesu, Flower of Mother-Maid,
As honey-comb to man display’d:
The glory of the world below,
Thy light’s true light on us bestow.

4 Than sun-ray more serenely calm,
More fragrant than the breath of balm
Sweeter than sweetness’ self can be,
And lovel{i}er than all else to see.

5 Jesu, who highest bounty art,
And wondrous joyaunce of the heart,
Of goodness the infinity,
Knit us in bond of love to thee.

6 O King of virtues, King renown’d,
With glory and with victory crown’d!
Jesu, who dost all grace supply,
The worship of the courts on high.

7 The Quires above thy praise proclaim,
And echo all thy matchless fame:
Jesus on joyful earth hath smiled,
And us to God hath reconciled.

8 All honour, laud, and glory be,
O Jesu, Virgin-born, to thee:
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.

\V Blessed be the Name of the Lord.  \R From this time forth for evermore.
